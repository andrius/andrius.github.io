  </p>

  <p>Hi, I'm Andrius Kairiukstis.</p>
  <p>DevOps Engineer. Voice Platform Architect. Team Player.</p>

  <p>
    I help companies scale their infrastructure through intelligent automation,
    robust system design, and collaborative engineering. With experience leading
    cross-functional teams and working across global remote networks, I bring
    both technical depth and the communication skills to make complex projects
    succeed.
